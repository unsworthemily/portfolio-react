      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>I am a 43-year-old professional with a strong sense of balance between career, family life, and personal development. <br /> Managing these areas has strengthened my ability to prioritize, stay focused, and think long-term. <br />Health and training are important parts of my life, not only as personal interests but as reflections of discipline, structure, and continuous improvement. <br /> I value consistency and growth — both physically and professionally. <br /> I am deeply curious about technology and how it can simplify processes, create smarter solutions, and improve everyday life as well as professional environments. <br /> I am motivated by learning, problem-solving, and combining practical thinking with strategic vision. <br />
